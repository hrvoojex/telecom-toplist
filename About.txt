Toplist-Com is an application which loads T-Com .csv phone bill files 
and writes them back to an output csv file as a top list. 

This application helps to quickly identify largest phone 
and internet consumers in the company. You can sort a list 
by internet data traffic, by amount which you have to pay 
to the telecom company or by the time spent on the phone talking.
